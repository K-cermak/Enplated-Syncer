## What is the difference between OneDrive/ Google Drive/ Dropbox and Enplated Syncer?
- Enplated Syncer is not a cloud storage service. It is a tool that allows you to synchronize data between devices.
- You only synchronize when you really want to. There is no automatic synchronization function implemented yet. 
- Enplated Syncer was developed with an focus on very fast synchronization. Compared to other applications, the synchronized data is compressed (without loss of quality) and the synchronization is instantaneous with accurate user notification.
- The biggest advantage of Enplated Syncer is that you can set exactly what folders you want to sync. Cloud services usually create a new folder. For example, Enplated Syncer can also sync system or configuration files without a problem.
- Enplated Syncer also does not collect any usage data or analyze any data. It is a free software that is open source and free to use.
